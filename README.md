Monty Project

Welcome to the Monty project! This project is an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files, a scripting language that relies on a unique stack with specific instructions for manipulation. The project includes the implementation of various opcodes and advanced functionalities.

 Usage
1. Compile the program: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty`
2. Run Monty with a bytecode file: `./monty <bytecode-file>`

Features
- Implemented opcodes such as push, pop, add, sub, div, mul, mod, and more.
- Supports stack and queue behavior using `stack` and `queue` opcodes.
- Brainf*ck scripts for arithmetic and printing tasks.
- Read, parse, and execute Monty ByteCodes files.

For details on available opcodes and usage, refer to the code files and comments in the repository.
